# DreamJournal

This application is built to allow users to record and share dreams.  Users can view other users dreams and comment on them.  Visitors can view dreams but cannot comment or add their own dreams.  This was my first application built using Rails with an emphasis on authentication and authorization for various levels of user experience.  The site offers seperate functionality for guests, users, and administrators. Authentication of users is performed using bcrypt.  While registered users can post (with an option for anonymous), edit, and delete their own dreams, as well as comment on others dreams, administrators can delete comments and dreams and categorize dreams.  I would like to add functionality that allows users to search for dream posts based on keywords.
