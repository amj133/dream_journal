      <p>This site is based on the idea that dreams are important, and that the more you pay attention to them
      the more revealing they can become.  Often times we take note of our dreams immediately following peak
      emotional experiences; a major break up, a death in the family, a career transition.  Perhaps the dream
      stays us with us for a day or two, allowing us to ruminate on its implications for what we value in our
      lives, only to be lost shortly thereafter.  Perhaps all, or many, of our dreams contain important information for us.
      Pay attention, see what happens, participte in the playground of our minds...</p>
